I have added another open source project to my list â€“ a JSON SerDe for Hive. You can check it out here:

http://code.google.com/p/hive-json-serde/

This SerDe (serializer/deserializer) will let you read JSON files as input for Hive tables. In the future, it will also support writing JSON data, but that is for another day.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions about it.
