For some strange reason, [Chrome OS](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html) is getting a lot of press. Is it a slow news day?

[They](http://opengardensblog.futuretext.com/archives/2009/07/google_chrome_o.html) say that it is direct competition to Microsoft, that it makes Linux less relevant... are they serious? Chrome OS is a non-announcement. There is a project that has existed for over 2 years called "[cl33n](http://cl33n.com/)". From the creator:

{% blockquote %}
Chrome OS is "Google Chrome running within a new windowing system on top of a Linux kernel."
cl33n is "Mozilla Firefox running in a little-used windowing system on top of a Linux kernel."
{% endblockquote %}

This "OS" is due to the released mid 2010. Is that how slowly things move inside Google? Why would it take them 12 months to create nothing more than cl33n?

What I am trying to say, is that Chrome OS is nothing new. Cl33n is not alone in this space either - other project like [Webconverger](http://webconverger.com/) share my view.

While on the subject of Google's non-annoucements, did you hear that Gmail, Doc, etc are out of beta. Big news huh? So what is their excuse now for daily "Server error" dialogs?
