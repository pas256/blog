When I first told my wife about Google releasing a phone, the very first words out of her mouth were:

{% blockquote %}
I would never buy a phone from Google. If something went wrong, Iâ€™m screwed! Its not like I can take it into a shop and get it fixed
{% endblockquote %}

How right she was. According to Slashdot, [Google is facing a deluge of customer complaints about the Nexus One](http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/10/01/08/2352202/Google-Faces-Deluge-of-Nexus-One-Complaints). Are you having problems? Use the hash tag [#fixgoogle](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23fixgoogle) if you are on Twitter. All tweets with that tag will appear on [fixgoogle.com](http://www.fixgoogle.com/) when I get the site up and running.
