I am please to announce to all my fans (haha) the [AWS Start-up Challenge video shot at Motally](http://aws.amazon.com/startupchallenge/) is finally live! This was my first ever professional video shoot - they spent 5 hours at our office to edit it down to 2 minutes. Motally was one of the 7 finalists, out of more than 1000 entries. Congratulations to [GoodData](http://www.gooddata.com/) and [Bizo](http://www.bizo.com/) for taking the top prizes!

I also want to call upon all of the mobile application developers out there. Motally is running a [mobile analytics contest called Trackappalooza](http://www.motally.com/contest/). Here you can win a pass to MWC in Barcelona, or up to $15,000 just for tracking your Android, iPhone or Blackberry app. [Motally is _the_ mobile analytics powerhouse](http://www.motally.com/) providing tracking capabilities for mobile websites and mobile applications.

Good luck!
