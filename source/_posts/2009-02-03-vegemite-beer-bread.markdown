I should have posted this on Australia Day (when we made it), but I haven't got around to it until now.

Aussie Vegemite Beer Bread

## Ingredients:

- 3 cups of self-rising (raising?) flour
- 1 beer (375mL can or 12oz bottle)
- 1 big knife-load of Vegemite
- Grated Parmesan cheese
- Left over butter

## Method:

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C)
1. Lightly grease a small bread tin (about 9 x 5 x 3 inches) with the butter
1. Get a big mixing bowl, tip in all the flour, add the beer and mix it up. We have found a whisk useless, but a spatula quite good
1. If you like parmesan cheese as much as us, add as much grated parmesan to the mix as you wish
1. Add the mix to the bread tin.
1. Load up a knife with vegemite and run it through the mix - the vegemite will come of the knife and marble through the dough
1. Bake for 60 minutes
1. If you didn't get your cheese fill, at the 40 minute mark, take the bread tin out, and sprinkle grated cheese on top of the bread
1. After 60 minutes, you should be able to put a skewer into the bread and have it come out clean. Let the bread cool a little, cut and eat as fast as possible :-)
