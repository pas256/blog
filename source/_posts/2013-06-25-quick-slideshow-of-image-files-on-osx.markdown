I only [recently discovered](http://www.cultofmac.com/165267/view-a-folder-full-of-photos-quickly-and-easily-os-x-tips/) a quick and easy way to start a slideshow on OSX from a list of images in a folder. From Finder, select all the images you want to display (`Command-A` for all) and then:

### `Option-Command-Y`

Not sure why this isn't more obvious as it is really handy. Enjoy.
