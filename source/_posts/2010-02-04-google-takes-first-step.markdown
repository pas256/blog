Google have taken a step in the right direction by offering people a [monetary reward when they find a bug in Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/2010/01/encouraging-more-chromium-security.html). I am very excited by this news, not because I am likely to find a bug and cash in, but because it shows Google is starting to take some accountability.

Step 2 would be public bug trackers for ALL of their systems, particularly the online ones such as Gmail, Docs, Sites, etc.

Step 3 would be Googlers actually paying attention to them, maybe even hiring a customer support team.

Fingers crossed!
