Peter has been a developer since he was 12 years old and the family bought a 386 with 4Mb of RAM and a massive 100Mb hard drive. It all started with MS-DOS 5.0 and a batch file menu system he created.

Now, many years, companies and countries later, he has founded a company called [Answers for AWS](http://answersforaws.com) to share his knowledge of using Amazon Web Services with others. Most recently, he was nominated for a [NetflixOSS Cloud Prize](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/09/netflixoss-meetup-s1e4-cloud-prize.html) and is waiting to see what happens at re:invent.

[Peter Sankauskas](http://www.linkedin.com/in/petersankauskas) is [@pas256](https://twitter.com/pas256) on Twitter and [pas256](http://github.com/pas256) on Github.

He enjoys long walks on the beach, candlelit dinners, and climbing the Sydney Harbour Bridge on launch days (Bluepulse). Peter is now living in Silicon Valley with his lovely wife, amazing son, enthusiastic dog and adventurous cat.

Peter has a Computer Science degree from the University of New South Wales in Sydney.
