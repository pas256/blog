- You can read it here: [Thesis - Profiling in Parallel to Reduce Overhead](peter-sankauskas-thesis.pdf)
- For my Computer Science thesis at UNSW, I developed a method of performing profiling of a program in parallel with the program's original code.
- This was targeted for the Intel Itanium family of processors and was developed using the [Open Research Compiler](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipf-orc/) (ORC).
- This thesis received a Distinction, allowing me to graduate with Honours.
